# COEN-79
Object Oriented Programming and Advanced Data Structures in C++

Labs taken during Fall 2018 

Lab 1 (CountPatternConvert): Count  the  number  of  alphanumeric  characters  and  non-alphanumeric  characters  from  the standard input, display a specific numeric pattern, and convert to uppercase and display all the words from an input file with length of at least 10 
characters in addition to removing all punctuation.

Lab 2 (Statistician Random): Generate a sequence of pseudorandom integers and implement a statistician class.

Lab 3 (Sequence): Implement a bag class that is ordered.

Lab 4 (Keyed Bag & Polynomials): Implement a keyed bag with arrays and create a polynomial class with algebraic and calculus functions.

Lab 5 (String Class): Implement a version of the Standard Library's string class.

Lab 6 (Sequence Class): A continuation of Lab 3; use a linked list instead of a static array.

Lab 7 (DatabaseNew): Implement a comapany class, whose information is stored into pointers that point to a linked list.

Lab 8 (Deque): Implement a deque class without using the Standard Library in addition to a forward iterator.

Lab 9 (Bag Binary Search Tree): Implement the bag template class using a binary search tree to store the items.
